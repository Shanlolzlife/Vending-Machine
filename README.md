# Vending-Machine
Y1S1 assignment python

Redo my assignment for y1s1 :)

Test Case:
if it's a customer:
  user cannot choose a non existing drink
  once the drink is out of stock user cannot bug the system and keep choosing the drink
  when paying user cannot escape till the payment is made
  if the user tries to be funny and try to type anything than the actual input the system will respond with the necessary error message

if it is a vender:
  choice == 1: where vender is adding new drink
  vender has to type a new short form for the drink only accepts 2 characters
  vender has to type a description less than 13 words and more than 3.
  vender has to also input a price that is not negative and if input more than 1 decimal place the system will give the vender 2 options whether to round it up or down
  when inputting the quantity the vender is to check if the stock is more than 5 else vender can only top up the vending machine to max 50 in quantity
  if the vender unput another input the system will respond with the necessary error message
